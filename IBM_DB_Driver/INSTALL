Installation for:
  DB2 V9:
    The tests that ibm_db uses depends on a UTF-8 database.  This can be
    created by running:
      CREATE DATABASE mydatabase USING CODESET UTF-8 TERRITORY US 
    Some of the tests utilize XML functionality only available in version 
    9 or later of DB2.

  DB2 V8:
    While DB2 V8.x is fully supported, two of the tests (test_195.rb and 
    test_52949.rb) utilize XML functionality.  These tests will fail on version 
    8.x of DB2.

Installation Preparations For Linux (specific commands dependent on shell):
  If you are compiling against a DB2 instance do the following (paths depend on system):
    . /home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile
    Use vi to edit config.yaml to your DB2 settings
  else if you are compiling against the DB2 client libraries do the following (paths depend on system):
    export IBM_DB_DIR=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.1
    export IBM_DB_LIB=/opt/IBM/db2/V9.1/lib32   
    Use vi to edit config.yaml to your DB2 settings

Installation Preparations For Windows:
  Install Ruby from:
    http://rubyforge.org
  Install Visual C++ 2003, Platform SDK (latest), .Net SDK Version 1.1 from:
    http://wiki.tcl.tk/11431
