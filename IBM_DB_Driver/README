Ruby Driver for IBM Databases
-----------------------------
This Ruby driver provides a Ruby interface for IBM databases.  The
driver has been developed and will be supported by IBM.  IBM welcomes
appropriate external contributions.  The driver currently supports
access to the IBM DB2 Database on Linux/Unix/Windows, IBM Cloudscape,
Apache Derby Database, and remote connections to i5/OS (iSeries).
Future database support will include native DB2 for
i5/OS (iSeries), and DB2 UDB for zOS.

Installation
------------
Please refer to the INSTALL file for complete details.

Setup to utilize ibm_db
-----------------------
For Unix based systems:
Depending on your shell, source the db2profile or db2cshrc.  Be sure
to source the profile for the DB2 instance and not the profile under
the DB2 product installation.  For example:
  . /home/db2inst1/sqllib/db2profile
                 or
  source /home/db2inst1/db2chsrc
In addtion to sourcing th DB2 environment, if you are compiling
against the DB2 client libraries, set the following environment
variables depending on your DB2 installation location.  For example:
  export IBM_DB_INCLUDE=/opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/include
  export IBM_DB_LIB=/opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/lib
                 or
  setenv IBM_DB_INCLUDE /opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/include
  setenv IBM_DB_LIB /opt/ibm/db2/V9.1/lib
